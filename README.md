# 🌤️ **Weather App**

### **Your Personal Weather Guide!**

Welcome to the **Weather App**, a React.js-based web application that delivers real-time weather updates for any location worldwide. This app leverages modern web technologies, including **React.js** and **API integration**, to provide users with a seamless and intuitive experience.

---

## 🚀 **Features**

- **Real-Time Weather Updates**: Get accurate weather details for any city or location worldwide.
- **Current Location Detection**: Automatically fetches your current location's weather (with user permission).
- **Fallback to Default Location**: If the user denies location access, the app gracefully defaults to show **Delhi's weather**.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A sleek and modern UI for a smooth user experience.
- **Fast & Responsive**: Optimized for performance and works seamlessly across devices.

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- **React.js**: For building a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: To fetch real-time weather data.
- **Geolocation API**: For detecting the user's current location.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsiveness.

---

## 🔥 **How It Works**

1. When the app is opened, it requests the user's location via the browser's **Geolocation API**.
2. If the user allows location access, the weather for their current location is displayed.
3. If the user denies location access, the app defaults to show the weather for **Delhi**.
4. The user can also search for weather in other cities using the search bar.
